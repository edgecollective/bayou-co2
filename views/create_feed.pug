h2 Simple, Free & Open Source CO2 Monitoring Data & Hardware

p.blurb <a href="/">Bayou-CO2</a> is designed to provide a simple, non-proprietary, 'open science' approach to capturing, storing, and retrieving CO2 sensor data. We created Bayou-CO2 when inspired by recent work (e.g. by Jimenez et al.) indicating that monitoring indoor CO2 levels might (in some contexts) help to assess the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

p.blurb <b>Open Data</b>. All data from Bayou can be downloaded via CSV or JSON, and is accessible via a simple link.  

p.blurb <b>Free and Open Source Codebase</b>. Bayou's source code is freely availble <a href="">here</a>. You can use the Bayou codebase to run a data server on your own hosting service (a home PC, or in the cloud).  You are welcome to fork the codebase, modify it, and improve it -- please do!

p.blurb <b>Funded through donations</b>. We rely on donations and pay-as-you-can arrangements to support data hosting, as well as hardware and software development. To help keep this site running, please visit our site on Open Collective <a href="https://opencollective.com/edgecollective">here</a>. Cheers!

p.h3_mock Build or Purchase a CO2 Sensor Kit

p.blurb We have developed an <a href="">Open Hardware CO2 monitoring kit</a>, based on an ESP32 microcontroller and an SCD30 CO2 sensor.  The design files, code, and instructions for building are all available; we are also able to distribute pre-assembled kits that are pre-programmed to send CO2 data to Bayou</b>. Click below to purchase a kit, or to learn how to source the parts for your own DIY build:
